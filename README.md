# GhostTrace

## Overview
GhostTrace is a stealth keylogger tool designed to record and log keystrokes efficiently. The tool operates in the background, ensuring that the user interface remains hidden while the keylogger captures the necessary input.

## Features
- **Stealth Mode**: The application hides its GUI after a brief display.
- **Character Logging**: Logs only valid typing characters (letters, numbers, punctuation).
- **Auto-Stop**: Keylogger stops when the 'Esc' key is pressed.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GhostTrace.git

   ```

3. Install required libraries:

## Usage
